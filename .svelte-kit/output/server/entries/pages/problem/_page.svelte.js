        our approach to improving chest X-ray classification and addressing model uncertainty.</p></section> <section id="background"><h2>Background</h2> <p>Chest radiography is an essential diagnostic tool, but interpreting X-rays can be difficult and subjective, even among experienced radiologists. Machine learning-based automation has the potential to enhance diagnostic efficiency, especially with access to large annotated datasets such as CheXpert.</p></section> <section id="problem-definition"><h2>Problem Definition</h2> <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Most research in chest X-ray classification has focused on maximizing classification accuracy, with little attention to understanding uncertainty in model outputs. Our project addresses two key challenges:</p> <ol><li>Identify image regions contributing to uncertainty in classification.</li> <li>Improve classification confidence through preprocessing and uncertainty-aware training strategies.</li></ol> <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">By addressing these challenges, we aim to enhance the interpretability and reliability of chest X-ray classification models.</p></section> <section id="motivation"><h2>Motivation</h2> <p>Chest X-ray analysis is an ideal application for machine learning due to the availability of large datasets. The CheXpert dataset includes over 200,000 labeled chest X-rays covering 14 medical conditions, with explicit annotations for uncertain labels (-1). This enables models to learn from ambiguous cases, improving real-world applicability.</p></section> <aside><div class="contents-header">On this page</div> <ul><li><a href="#problem">Problem</a></li> <li><a href="#background">Background</a></li> <li><a href="#problem-definition">Problem Definition</a></li> <li><a href="#motivation">Motivation</a></li></ul></aside>`;
