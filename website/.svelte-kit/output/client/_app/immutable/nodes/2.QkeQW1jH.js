The recent availability of large-scale, annotated X-ray datasets, such as CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR, has fueled interest in developing machine learning models for automated diagnosis.</p></section> <section id="key-goals"><h2>Key Goals</h2> <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">However, uncertainty in model predictions and quality issues in training data pose significant challenges. Our project aims to:</p> <ul><li>Improve classification accuracy and uncertainty analysis using pre-trained CNN architectures (e.g., DenseNet, ResNet).</li> <li>Leverage preprocessing techniques like histogram equalization and difference of Gaussians to enhance image quality.</li> <li>Use Grad-CAM visualizations to identify influential regions in X-ray images, enabling better interpretability.</li> <li>Incorporate uncertainty labels (-1) into the model pipeline to handle ambiguous cases.</li></ul></section> <aside><div class="contents-header">On this page</div> <ul><li><a href="#home">Home</a></li> <li><a href="#introduction">Introduction</a></li> <li><a href="#key-goals">Key Goals</a></li></ul></aside>',1);function d(e){var i=o();a(6),n(e,i)}export{d as component};
